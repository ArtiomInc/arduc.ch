# arduc.ch

Hi! This is the repository for my portfolio that you can find here: https://arduc.ch. I was design inspired by a React developer who created their own portfolio on melvynx.com, and I tried to rebuild it from scratch.

I used Vue3 technology to divide my project into several reusable components, allowing me to achieve a better structure in the project. The interface design was done using pure CSS or Tailwind CSS.

## Start developing

```bash
cd arduc.ch
npm install
npm run dev
```
